# WinRM
I used WinRM AFTER obtaining credentials via other means

## evil-winrm
https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm
```
# Below I used credentials, it can be also used with NThash (but not NTLMv2 hash)
evil-winrm -u <user> -p <administrator> -i <IP>
```
After connecting we get a normal shell access.
