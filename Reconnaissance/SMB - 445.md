## Intro
Recon of the SMB services on both Linux and Windows


## Nmap
Use nmap scripts for additional enumeration
```
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.68.87
```
Interesting findings include
- anonymous share
- share with weird name

### Smbclient
Connect to the anonymous share
```
smbclient //<IP>/anonymous
# In case of "/" error do it like this
smbclient ////<IP>//anonymous
```
