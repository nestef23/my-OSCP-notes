## Intro
Scanning of the web app or API

### Steps
0. Manually go through all website. Click buttons and links, read source code and comments, visit robots.txt (Burp, Browser)
1. Discover hidden files and directories (Dirb)
2. Manually go through all discovered stuff
3. Guess default passwords, if common application (Manual)
4. Brute-force login panels (???)
5. Check for SQLi (???) (SQLmap is banned!)
6. Check is the web server or other technologies are not vulnerable

## Burp Suite
Burp is great, but in the free version it is good only for manual recon.
Burp Pro is banned!

## Nikto
Sometimes finds something interesting
```
nikto -host <IP>
```

## Dirb
Great for discovering folders and filenames
```
# Use the common wordlist
dirb http://<Target>
# Use custom wordlist
dirb http://<Target>
```

## Gobuster
Similar to Dirb
```
gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
```
